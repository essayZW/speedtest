# LibreSpeed - Docker Documentation

## Downloading from Docker hub
To download LibreSpeed from the docker hub, use this command:
```
docker pull adolfintel/speedtest
```

You will now have a new docker image called `adolfintel/speedtest`.

## Standalone mode
If you want to install LibreSpeed on a single server, you need to configure it in standalone mode. To do this, set the `MODE` environment variable to `standalone`.

The test can be accessed on port 80.

Here's a list of additional environment variables available in this mode:
* __`TITLE`__: Title of your speedtest. Default value: `LibreSpeed`
* __`TELEMETRY`__: Whether to enable telemetry or not. Default value: `false`
* __`ENABLE_ID_OBFUSCATION`__: When set to true with telemetry enabled, test IDs are obfuscated, to avoid exposing the database internal sequential IDs. Default value: `false`
* __`REDACT_IP_ADDRESSES`__: When set to true with telemetry enabled, IP addresses and hostnames are redacted from the collected telemetry, for better privacy. Default value: `false`
* __`PASSWORD`__: Password to access the stats page. If not set, stats page will not allow accesses.
* __`EMAIL`__: Email address for GDPR requests. Must be specified when telemetry is enabled.
* __`IPINFO_APIKEY`__: API key for ipinfo.io. Optional, but required if you expect to serve a large number of tests
* __`DISABLE_IPINFO`__: If set to true, ISP info and distance will not be fetched from ipinfo.io. Default: value: `false`
* __`DISTANCE`__: When `DISABLE_IPINFO` is set to false, this specifies how the distance from the server is measured. Can be either `km` for kilometers, `mi` for miles, or an empty string to disable distance measurement. Default value: `km`

If telemetry is enabled, a stats page will be available at `http://your.server/results/stats.php`, but a password must be specified.

###### Example
This command starts LibreSpeed in standalone mode, with the default settings, on port 80:

```
docker run -e MODE=standalone -p 80:80 -it adolfintel/speedtest
```

We must distinguish 2 types of servers:
* __Frontend server__: hosts the UI, the JS files, and optionally telemetry and results sharing stuff. You only need 1 of these, and this is the server that your clients will first connect to.
* __Test backends__: the servers used to actually perform the test. There can be 1+ of these, and they only host the backend files.

#### Frontend server
This is the server that your users will first connect to. It hosts the UI, the JS files, and optionally telemetry and results sharing stuff.

Requirements:
* Apache 2 (nginx and IIS also supported). A fast connection is not mandatory, but is still recommended
* PHP 5.4 or newer
* If you want to store test results (telemetry), one of the following:
    - MySQL/MariaDB and the mysqli PHP module
    - PostgreSQL and its PHP PDO module
    - SQLite 3 and its PHP PDO module
* If you want to enable results sharing:
    - FreeType 2 and its PHP module (this is usually installed automatically by most distros)

To install the speedtest frontend, copy the following files to your web server:
* `speedtest.js`
* `speedtest_worker.js`
* Optionally, the `results` folder
* One of the `multipleServers` examples (the best starting points are `example-multipleServers-pretty.html` if you don't want to use telemetry and results sharing, `example-multipleServers-full.html` if you want to use them). Rename the example you choose to `index.html`

__Important:__ The speedtest needs write permissions in the installation folder!

##### Server list
Edit `index.html`, you will see a list of servers:
```js
var SPEEDTEST_SERVERS=[
	{
		"name":"Speedtest Demo Server 1", //user friendly name for the server
		"server":"//mpotdemo.fdossena.com/", //URL to the server. // at the beginning will be replaced with http:// or https:// automatically
		"dlURL":"garbage.php",  //path to download test on this server (garbage.php or replacement)
		"ulURL":"empty.php",  //path to upload test on this server (empty.php or replacement)
		"pingURL":"empty.php",  //path to ping/jitter test on this server (empty.php or replacement)
		"getIpURL":"getIP.php"  //path to getIP on this server (getIP.php or replacement)
	},
	{
		"name":"Speedtest Demo Server 2",
		"server":"//mpotdemo2.fdossena.com/",
		"dlURL":"garbage.php",
		"ulURL":"empty.php",
		"pingURL":"empty.php",
		"getIpURL":"getIP.php"
	}
	//add other servers here, comma separated
];
```

Replace the demo servers with your test points. Each server in the list is an object containing:
* `"name"`: user friendly name for this test point
* `"server"`: URL to the server. If your server only supports HTTP or HTTPS, put http:// or https:// at the beginning, respectively; if it supports both, put // at the beginning and it will be replaced automatically
* `"dlURL"`: path to the download test on this server (garbage.php or replacement)
* `"ulURL"`: path to the upload test on this server (empty.php or replacement)
* `"pingURL"`: path to the ping test on this server (empty.php or replacement)
* `"getIpURL"`: path to getIP on this server (getIP.php or replacement)

None of these parameters can be omitted.

__Important__: You can't mix HTTP with HTTPS; if the frontend uses HTTP, you won't be able to connect to HTTPS backends, and viceversa.

__Important__: For HTTPS, all your servers must have valid certificates or the browser will refuse to connect

__Important__: Don't use my demo servers, they're slow!

If your list of servers changes often, you might not want to have it hardcoded in the HTML file. LibreSpeed can load the server list from a JSON file. To do this, edit `index.html` and replace the list of servers with this:
```js
var SPEEDTEST_SERVERS="your URL here";
```

The URL doesn't need to be complete, it can just point to a file in the current directory. The URL should point to a JSON file with the same format used above:
```js
[
    {
        "name":...
    },
    ...
]
```

__Important:__ The same origin policy applies to which URLs you can and cannot load with this method. If possible, it's best to just point it to a file on the current server.

##### Telemetry and results sharing
Telemetry is stored on the frontend server. The setup procedure is the same as the single server version.

#### Test backends
These are the servers that will actually be used to perform the test.

Requirements:
* Apache 2 (nginx and IIS also supported). A fast internet connection is required (possibly gigabit), and the web server must accept large POST requests (up to 20MB)
* PHP 5.4 or newer
* OpenSSL and its PHP module (this is usually installed automatically by most distros)

To install a backend, simply copy all the files in the `backend` folder to your backend server.

__Important:__ The speedtest needs write permissions in the installation folder!

#### ipinfo.io
The speedtest uses [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) to detect ISP and distance from server. This is completely optional and can be disabled if you want (see Speedtest settings), but it is enabled by default, and if you expect more than ~500 tests per day, you will need to sign up to [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) and edit `getIP_ipInfo_apikey.php` to set your access token.

IpInfo.io has kindly offered free access to their APIs for users of this project; if you're interested, contact me at [info@fdossena.com](mailto:info@fdossena.com) and provide a description of what you intend to do with the project, and you'll get the API key.

## Making a custom front-end
This section explains how to use speedtest.js in your webpages.

The best way to learn is by looking at the provided examples.

__Single server:__
* `example-singleServer-basic.html`: The most basic configuration possible. Runs the test with the default settings when the page is loaded and displays the results with no fancy graphics.
* `example-singleServer-pretty.html`: A more sophisticated example with a nicer layout and a start/stop button. __This is the best starting point for most users__
* `example-singleServer-progressBar.html`: Same as `example-singleServer-pretty.html` but adds a progress indicator
* `example-singleServer-customSettings.html`: Same as `example-singleServer-pretty.html` but configures the test so that it only performs download and upload tests, and with a fixed length instead of automatic
* `example-singleServer-gauges.html`: The most sophisticated example, with the same functionality as `example-singleServer-pretty.html` but adds gauges. This is also a good starting point, but the gauges may slow down underpowered devices
* `example-singleServer-chart.html`: Shows how to use the test with the Chart.js library
* `example-singleServer-full.html`: The most complete example. Based on `example-singleServer-gauges.html`, also enables telemetry and results sharing

__Multiple servers:__
* `example-multipleServers-pretty.html`: Same as `example-singleServer-pretty.html` but with multiple test points. Server selection is fully automatic
* `example-multipleServers-full.html`: Same as `example-singleServer-full.html` but with multiple test points. Server selection is automatic but the server can be changed afterwards by the user

### Initialization
To use the speedtest in your page, first you need to load it:
```xml
<script type="text/javascript" src="speedtest.js"></script>
```

After loading, you can initialize the test:
```js
var s=new Speedtest();
```

### Event handlers
Now, you can set up event handlers to update your UI:
```js
s.onupdate=function(data){
    //update your UI here
}
s.onend=function(aborted){
    //end of the test
    if(aborted){
        //something to do if the test was aborted instead of ending normally
    }
}
>>>>>>> master
```

This command starts LibreSpeed in standalone mode, with telemetry, ID obfuscation and a stats password, on port 80:

```
docker run -e MODE=standalone -e TELEMETRY=true -e ENABLE_ID_OBFUSCATION=true -e PASSWORD="botnet123" -p 80:80 -it adolfintel/speedtest
```
And now the test results will be stored and we will get our test ID at the end of the test (along with the other data)

__Main parameters:__
* __time_dl_max__: Maximum duration of the download test in seconds. If auto duration is disabled, this is used as the duration of the test.
    * Default: `15`
    * Recommended: `>=5`
* __time_ul_max__: Maximum duration of the upload test in seconds. If auto duration is disabled, this is used as the duration of the test.
    * Default: `15`
    * Recommended: `>=10`
* __time_auto__: Automatically determine the duration of the download and upload tests, making them faster on faster connections, to avoid wasting data.
    * Default: `true`
* __count_ping__: How many pings to perform in the ping test
    * Default: `10`
    * Recommended: `>=3, <30`
* __url_dl__: path to garbage.php or a large file to use for the download test.
    * Default: `garbage.php`
    * __Important:__ path is relative to js file
* __url_ul__: path to an empty file or empty.php to use for the upload test
    * Default: `empty.php`
    * __Important:__ path is relative to js file
* __url_ping__: path to an empty file or empty.php to use for the ping test
    * Default: `empty.php`
    * __Important:__ path is relative to js file
* __url_getIp__: path to getIP.php or replacement
    * Default: `getIP.php`
    * __Important:__ path is relative to js file
* __url_telemetry__: path to telemetry.php or replacement
    * Default: `results/telemetry.php`
    * __Important:__ path is relative to js file
	* __Note:__ you can ignore this parameter if you're not using the telemetry
* __telemetry_level__: The type of telemetry to use. See the telemetry section for more info about this
	* Default: `none`
	* `basic`: send results only
	* `full`: send results and timing information, even for aborted tests
	* `debug`: same as full but also sends debug information. Not recommended.
* __test_order__: the order in which tests will be performed. You can use this to change the order of the test, or to only enable specific tests. Each character represents an operation:
    * `I`: get IP
    * `D`: download test
    * `U`: upload test
    * `P`: ping + jitter test
    * `_`: delay 1 second
    * Default test order: `IP_D_U`
    * __Important:__ Tests can only be run once
    * __Important:__ On Firefox, it is better to run the upload test last
* __getIp_ispInfo__: if true, the server will try to get ISP info and pass it along with the IP address. This will add `isp=true` to the request to `url_getIp`. getIP.php accomplishes this using ipinfo.io
    * Default: `true`
* __getIp_ispInfo_distance__: if true, the server will try to get an estimate of the distance from the client to the speedtest server. This will add a `distance` argument to the request to `url_getIp`. `__getIp_ispInfo__` must be enabled in order for this to work. getIP.php accomplishes this using ipinfo.io
    * `km`: estimate distance in kilometers
    * `mi`: estimate distance in miles
    * not set: do not measure distance
    * Default: `km`

__Advanced parameters:__ (Seriously, don't change these unless you know what you're doing)
* __telemetry_extra__: Extra data that you want to be passed to the telemetry. This is a string field, if you want to pass an object, make sure you use ``JSON.stringify``. This string will be added to the database entry for this test.
* __enable_quirks__: enables browser-specific optimizations. These optimizations override some of the default settings. They do not override settings that are explicitly set.
    * Default: `true`
* __garbagePhp_chunkSize__: size of chunks sent by garbage.php in megabytes
    * Default: `100`
    * Recommended: `>=10`
    * Maximum: `1024`
* __xhr_dlMultistream__: how many streams should be opened for the download test
    * Default: `6`
    * Recommended: `>=3`
    * Default override: 3 on Edge if enable_quirks is true
    * Default override: 5 on Chromium-based if enable_quirks is true
* __xhr_ulMultistream__: how many streams should be opened for the upload test
    * Default: `3`
    * Recommended: `>=1`
* __xhr_ul_blob_megabytes__: size in megabytes of the blobs sent during the upload test
	* Default: `20`
	* Default override: 4 on Chromium-based mobile browsers (limitation introduced around version 65). This will be forced
	* Default override: IE11 and Edge currently use a different method for the upload test. This parameter is ignored
* __xhr_multistreamDelay__: how long should the multiple streams be delayed (in ms)
    * Default: `300`
    * Recommended: `>=100`, `<=700`
* __xhr_ignoreErrors__: how to react to errors in download/upload streams and the ping test
    * `0`: Fail test on error (behaviour of previous versions of this test)
    * `1`: Restart a stream/ping when it fails
    * `2`: Ignore all errors
    * Default: `1`
    * Recommended: `1`
* __time_dlGraceTime__: How long to wait (in seconds) before actually measuring the download speed. This is a good idea because we want to wait for the TCP window to be at its maximum (or close to it)
    * Default: `1.5`
    * Recommended: `>=0`
* __time_ulGraceTime__: How long to wait (in seconds) before actually measuring the upload speed. This is a good idea because we want to wait for the buffers to be full (avoids the peak at the beginning of the test)
    * Default: `3`
    * Recommended: `>=1`
* __ping_allowPerformanceApi__: toggles use of Performance API to improve accuracy of Ping/Jitter test on browsers that support it.
	* Default: `true`
	* Default override: `false` on Firefox because its performance API implementation is inaccurate
* __useMebibits__: use mebibits/s instead of megabits/s for the speeds
	* Default: `false`
* __overheadCompensationFactor__: compensation for HTTP and network overhead. Default value assumes typical MTUs used over the Internet. You might want to change this if you're using this in your internal network with different MTUs, or if you're using IPv6 instead of IPv4.
    * Default: `1.06` probably a decent estimate for all overhead. This was measured empirically by comparing the measured speed and the speed reported by my the network adapter.
    * `1048576/925000`: old default value. This is probably too high.
	* `1.0513`: HTTP+TCP+IPv6+ETH, over the Internet (empirically tested, not calculated)
    * `1.0369`: Alternative value for HTTP+TCP+IPv4+ETH, over the Internet (empirically tested, not calculated)
	* `1.081`: Yet another alternative value for over the Internet (empirically tested, not calculated)
    * `1514 / 1460`: TCP+IPv4+ETH, ignoring HTTP overhead
    * `1514 / 1440`: TCP+IPv6+ETH, ignoring HTTP overhead
    * `1`: ignore overheads. This measures the speed at which you actually download and upload files rather than the raw connection speed

## Multiple Points of Test
For multiple servers, you need to set up 1+ LibreSpeed backends, and 1 LibreSpeed frontend.

### Backend mode
In backend mode, LibreSpeed provides only a test point with no UI. To do this, set the `MODE` environment variable to `backend`.

The following backend files can be accessed on port 80: `garbage.php`, `empty.php`, `getIP.php`

Here's a list of additional environment variables available in this mode:
* __`IPINFO_APIKEY`__: API key for ipinfo.io. Optional, but required if you expect to serve a large number of tests

###### Example:
This command starts LibreSpeed in backend mode, with the default settings, on port 80:
```
docker run -e MODE=backend -p 80:80 -it adolfintel/speedtest
```

### Frontend mode
In frontend mode, LibreSpeed serves clients the Web UI and a list of servers. To do this:
* Set the `MODE` environment variable to `frontend`
* Create a `servers.json` file with your test points. The syntax is the following:
    ```
    [
        {
            "name": "Friendly name for Server 1",
            "server" :"//server1.mydomain.com/",
            "dlURL" :"garbage.php",
            "ulURL" :"empty.php",
            "pingURL" :"empty.php",
            "getIpURL" :"getIP.php"
        },
        {
            "name": "Friendly name for Server 2",
            "server" :"https://server2.mydomain.com/",
            "dlURL" :"garbage.php",
            "ulURL" :"empty.php",
            "pingURL" :"empty.php",
            "getIpURL" :"getIP.php"
        },
        ...more servers...
    ]
    ```
    Note: if a server only supports HTTP or HTTPS, specify the protocol in the server field. If it supports both, just use `//`.
    If you want the test to load this list from an URL instead of a file, just put the URL that you want to be loaded in the file in quotes, like this:
    ```
    "//mydomain.com/ServerList.json"
    ```
    It doesn't need to be a complete URL, if it's the same domain you can just specify the file name. Note that the same origin policy still applies.
* Mount this file to `/servers.json` in the container
    
The test can be accessed on port 80.

Here's a list of additional environment variables available in this mode:
* __`TITLE`__: Title of your speedtest. Default value: `LibreSpeed`
* __`TELEMETRY`__: Whether to enable telemetry or not. Default value: `false`
* __`ENABLE_ID_OBFUSCATION`__: When set to true with telemetry enabled, test IDs are obfuscated, to avoid exposing the database internal sequential IDs. Default value: `false`
* __`REDACT_IP_ADDRESSES`__: When set to true with telemetry enabled, IP addresses and hostnames are redacted from the collected telemetry, for better privacy. Default value: `false`
* __`PASSWORD`__: Password to access the stats page. If not set, stats page will not allow accesses.
* __`EMAIL`__: Email address for GDPR requests. Must be specified when telemetry is enabled.
* __`DISABLE_IPINFO`__: If set to true, ISP info and distance will not be fetched from ipinfo.io. Default: value: `false`
* __`DISTANCE`__: When `DISABLE_IPINFO` is set to false, this specifies how the distance from the server is measured. Can be either `km` for kilometers, `mi` for miles, or an empty string to disable distance measurement. Default value: `km`

###### Example
This command starts LibreSpeed in frontend mode, with a given `servers.json` file, and with telemetry, ID obfuscation, and a stats password:
```
docker run -e MODE=frontend -e TELEMETRY=true -e ENABLE_ID_OBFUSCATION=true -e PASSWORD="botnet123" -v ./my_servers.json:/servers.json -p 80:80 -it adolfintel/speedtest
```

Note that this will add `mpot`:`true` to the parameters sent to the speedtest worker.
